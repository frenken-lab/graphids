# KD-GAT: CAN Bus Intrusion Detection via Knowledge Distillation

CAN bus intrusion detection using a 3-stage knowledge distillation pipeline:
VGAE (unsupervised reconstruction) → GAT (supervised classification) → fusion.
Large models are compressed into small models via KD auxiliaries for edge deployment.

## Code Philosophy

Every function, file, and abstraction must earn its place. Before writing code, answer: does a dependency already do this? Can this be inlined? Does this file need to exist or can it be 10 lines somewhere else? If you can't justify it in one sentence, delete it. When a plan says simplify — that means less code, not different code.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Training
python -m graphids fit --config graphids/config/stages/autoencoder.yaml
python -m graphids fit --config graphids/config/stages/normal.yaml --config graphids/config/overlays/small_gat.yaml

# Evaluation
python -m graphids test --config graphids/config/stages/autoencoder.yaml --ckpt_path best.ckpt

# Analysis artifacts (embeddings, CKA, loss landscape)
python -m graphids analyze --config graphids/config/stages/analyze_vgae.yaml \
    --analyzer.ckpt_path path/to/best.ckpt --analyzer.dataset hcrl_sa
```

## CLI Architecture

`GraphIDSCLI`, `WandbSaveConfigCallback`, and `CLI_KWARGS` live in `graphids/cli.py` — single definition shared by
`__main__.py` (training) and `orchestrate/` (validation). `WandbSaveConfigCallback` forwards
full jsonargparse config to wandb (Lightning #19728 workaround). Two entry points:

- `python -m graphids fit|test|validate|predict` → `GraphIDSCLI` (extends `LightningCLI`, adds `link_arguments` for DRY config)
- `python -m graphids analyze` → `Analyzer` class (no Trainer — loads checkpoints, generates artifacts)

Orchestration: `python -m graphids.orchestrate [run|validate|smoke]` — dagster-based, see `plans/architecture/dagster-native-orchestration.md`

Dagster UI: `bash scripts/dev/dagster-ui.sh` (webserver + daemon on login node, port 3000). Access via SSH tunnel.

Fusion has per-method stage YAMLs: `fusion_bandit.yaml` (`BanditFusionModule`), `fusion_dqn.yaml` (`DQNFusionModule`), `fusion_mlp.yaml` (`MLPFusionModule`), `fusion_weighted_avg.yaml` (`WeightedAvgModule`). Config resolution in `component.py` picks the right YAML from `fusion_method` in the recipe.

## Session Start

Always read `PLAN.md` before starting work. Update it after completing any task.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **KD-GAT** (5341 symbols, 6536 relationships, 150 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## When Debugging

1. `gitnexus_query({query: "<error or symptom>"})` — find execution flows related to the issue
2. `gitnexus_context({name: "<suspect function>"})` — see all callers, callees, and process participation
3. `READ gitnexus://repo/KD-GAT/process/{processName}` — trace the full execution flow step by step
4. For regressions: `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` — see what your branch changed

## When Refactoring

- **Renaming**: MUST use `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` first. Review the preview — graph edits are safe, text_search edits need manual review. Then run with `dry_run: false`.
- **Extracting/Splitting**: MUST run `gitnexus_context({name: "target"})` to see all incoming/outgoing refs, then `gitnexus_impact({target: "target", direction: "upstream"})` to find all external callers before moving code.
- After any refactor: run `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "all"})` to verify only expected files changed.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## Tools Quick Reference

| Tool | When to use | Command |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Find code by concept | `gitnexus_query({query: "auth validation"})` |
| `context` | 360-degree view of one symbol | `gitnexus_context({name: "validateUser"})` |
| `impact` | Blast radius before editing | `gitnexus_impact({target: "X", direction: "upstream"})` |
| `detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check | `gitnexus_detect_changes({scope: "staged"})` |
| `rename` | Safe multi-file rename | `gitnexus_rename({symbol_name: "old", new_name: "new", dry_run: true})` |
| `cypher` | Custom graph queries | `gitnexus_cypher({query: "MATCH ..."})` |

## Impact Risk Levels

| Depth | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| d=1 | WILL BREAK — direct callers/importers | MUST update these |
| d=2 | LIKELY AFFECTED — indirect deps | Should test |
| d=3 | MAY NEED TESTING — transitive | Test if critical path |

## Resources

| Resource | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `gitnexus://repo/KD-GAT/context` | Codebase overview, check index freshness |
| `gitnexus://repo/KD-GAT/clusters` | All functional areas |
| `gitnexus://repo/KD-GAT/processes` | All execution flows |
| `gitnexus://repo/KD-GAT/process/{name}` | Step-by-step execution trace |

## Self-Check Before Finishing

Before completing any code modification task, verify:
1. `gitnexus_impact` was run for all modified symbols
2. No HIGH/CRITICAL risk warnings were ignored
3. `gitnexus_detect_changes()` confirms changes match expected scope
4. All d=1 (WILL BREAK) dependents were updated

## CLI

- Re-index: `npx gitnexus analyze`
- Check freshness: `npx gitnexus status`
- Generate docs: `npx gitnexus wiki`
