# KD-GAT: CAN Bus Intrusion Detection via Knowledge Distillation

CAN bus intrusion detection using a 3-stage knowledge distillation pipeline:
VGAE (unsupervised reconstruction) → GAT (supervised classification) → fusion.
Large models are compressed into small models via KD auxiliaries for edge deployment.

## Code Philosophy

Every function, file, and abstraction must earn its place. Before writing code, answer: does a dependency already do this? Can this be inlined? Does this file need to exist or can it be 10 lines somewhere else? If you can't justify it in one sentence, delete it. When a plan says simplify — that means less code, not different code.

## Key Commands

## Session Start

Always read `PLAN.md` before starting work. Update it after completing any task.

## Rules (auto-loaded from `.claude/rules/`)

modular rule files covering architecture, config, constraints, code style, SLURM, experiment tracking, PyTorch compat, shell environment, and project structure. See `.claude/rules/` directly.
